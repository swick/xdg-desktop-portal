      @short_description: Abstraction of app-engine specifics

      The PortalHelper interface provides information about apps and exposes
      actions which require app-engine specific knowledge. It is not a portal
      but a service exposed by app-engines such as Flatpak or Snap.

      This documentation describes version 1 of this interface.

        Get information about a running app instance.

        * ``failed_barriers`` (``au``)

          #org.freedesktop.impl.portal.InputCapture::Activated signal.
